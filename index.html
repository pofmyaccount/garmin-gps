                <h3>Document Your Issue Thoroughly</h3>
                <p>Before contacting support, document the specific symptoms of your issue, including when it occurs, any error messages displayed, and the steps that trigger the problem.

                <h3>Check Service Status</h3>
                <p>If you're experiencing issues with connected services like Garmin Connect, check the system status page on Garmin's website before contacting support.

                <h3>Have Your Product Information Ready</h3>
                <p>Keep your product's serial number, model number, and purchase information accessible when contacting support. This information is often required to provide personalized assistance and determine warranty status.</p>
